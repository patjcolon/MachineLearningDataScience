Practicing Machine Learning and Data Science: Linear Regression
by patjcolon
This project is my first intro to Machine Learning and Data Science
I am following through on the Machine Learning Course offered by appbrewery.com

In this project I compare the top 5000+ budget movies 
and compare their budget to their international gross income.
I practice using pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib
